## Why

Master Data Management (MDM) aims to address data disarray and inconsistencies in an enterprise's critical data assets (such as customer and supplier chains) by providing a single, accurate, and trusted view for business operations.

## Problem 
  
Operational inefficiency in manually searching, validating, or correcting data leads to inconsistent management reports and analytical results, and decision makers lose confidence in the data.
  
## Causes  
   
1. Data silos and fragmentation: Data is scattered across multiple independent application systems.  
2. Poor data quality: Duplicates, inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or incomplete records exist within the data.  
3. Lack of data governance and control: Lack of processes and accountability for defining and managing master data, allowing data to be modified at will.
